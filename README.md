# ChicagoSightSeeingApp
# Description
This is the introductory project I did for my Framework-Based Development class. It was developed using Flutter and the Android Studio IDE. This app was created with the purpose of providing information about Chicago to users. The App contains three separate tabs: EAT, SLEEP, and SEE. Under each tab, there are three different buttons for the different locations associated with each category. Upon clicking the button, the Screen switches to a new page that provides the address of the location and a brief description of the place. There is also a floating action button on the bottom of the screen that allows the user to like the location. Upon clicking the button, a snack bar appears, displaying the total likes the location has.
