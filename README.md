# ChicagoSightSeeingApp
# Description
This is the introductory project I did for Framework-Based Devlopment class. It was developed using Flutter and the Android Studio IDE. This app was created with the purpose of providing information about Chicago to the users. The App contains three separate tabs: EAT, SLEEP, and SEE. Under each tab, there are three different buttons for the different locations associated with each category. Upon clicking the button, the Screen switches to a new page that provides the address of the location and a brief description of the place. There is also a floating action button on the bottom of the screen that allows the user to like the location. Upon clciking the button, a snackbar appears, displaying the total likes the location has.
