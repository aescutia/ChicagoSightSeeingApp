# Chicago Sightseeing App
This repository contains a sightseeing app I developed, showcasing some popular locations in Chicago. I wrote this code in Spring 2022 for my Cross-Platform Development class, and it is written using Flutter.

## About Ths Project:
The purpose of this project is to provide information about Chicago to visitors. The app contains the following tabs: Eat, Sleep, and See. Each tab contains three locations that are associated with each category. Upon clicking a location, the user is navigated to a page that displays the address and a brief description of the location.

## How To Use
- Android Studio is required, along with the latest version of Flutter.
- Unzip the folder and open the project through Android Studio
- Once the code is running, select any of the three tabs on the screen
- To learn more about a location, click on the location to navigate to the info screen
- To like a location, click on the button at the bottom of the info screen
